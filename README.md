# hello-world
This repository is for practicing GitHub Flow
My name is Seb, I am an aspiring developer ready to learn all there is about GitHub.
I like to draw and play video games. I would like to use my artistic and coding abilities in the future to develop video games. I also enjoy watching movies and have a growing collection of Blu-Rays!
